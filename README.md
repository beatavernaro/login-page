<h1> My very first project </h1>
<p> Hello!
I've made this a while ago and it was the first project i did using HTML and CSS. It was donne in the first week i started studying Front-End development.
I'm quite happy to see the evolution within these 3 months of hard work and study, what took me day to make now is made in only a few hours and with much more functionalities. Enjoy. </p>
